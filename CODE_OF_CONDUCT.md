This Code of Conduct makes our expectations of participants in this community explicit.
- We forbid harassment and abusive speech within this community.
- We ask that you report any harassment and abusive speech.
## Expected Behaviors
- We expect participants in this community to conduct themselves professionally. Since our primary mode of communication is text on an online forum (e.g. issues, pull requests, comments, emails, or chats) devoid of vocal tone, gestures, or other context that is often vital to understanding, it is important that participants are attentive to their interaction style.
- Assume positive intent. We ask community members to assume positive intent on the part of other people’s communications. We may disagree on details, but we expect all suggestions to be supportive of the community goals.
- Respect participants.
- We expect occasional disagreements. Open Source projects are learning experiences. Ask, explore, challenge, and then respectfully state if you agree or disagree. If your idea is rejected, be more persuasive not bitter.
- Welcoming to new members. New members bring new perspectives. Some ask questions that have been addressed before. Kindly point to existing discussions. Everyone is new to every project once.
Be kind to beginners. Beginners use open source projects to get experience. They might not be talented coders yet, and projects should not accept poor quality code. But we were all beginners once, and we need to engage kindly.
- Consider your impact on others. Your work will be used by others, and you depend on the work of others. We expect community members to be considerate and establish a balance their self-interest with communal interest.
- Use words carefully. We may not understand intent when you say something ironic. Often, people will misinterpret sarcasm in online communications. We ask community members to communicate plainly.
Leave with class. When you wish to resign from participating in this project for any reason, you are free to fork the code and create a competitive project. Open Source explicitly allows this. Your exit should not be dramatic or bitter.

  - Cyberbullying
